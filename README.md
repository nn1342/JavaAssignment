# Java Backend Software Engineer Take-Home Assessment 

This assessment is an opportunity for the candidate to provide examples of their knowledge and skills using technologies and practices they may see working for Crimson Interactive. It is also an opportunity for the Crimson Interactive software development team to evaluate the candidate's use of these skills and technologies. This assessment will be used as points of discussion during any additional interviews.

## Your challenge

### MVP Project
This project is the only part of this challenge we consider required. Create a project that can be tested with Postman (No frontend component required for this project) so that we are able to complete CRUD operations via the REST API. The **_user summary_**, **_technical summary_**, and **_user stories_** for this project are listed below in the [fictitious-company-inc-blog-app-requirements-mvp.md](https://gist.github.com/IntrepidDemian/b6add456dc3af28e9e959bcc6a244be2#file-fictitious-company-inc-blog-app-requirements-mvp-md) document. Please also read the **_constraints_** section as they apply to the project as well. If something is not covered in the constraints or starter application, the decision of implementation is left up to you.

### Stretch Goal Project
As the name suggests, this part of the assessment is a stretch goal and is NOT required. We want to extend our MVP project. Again, it will be tested with Postman (No frontend component required for this project) so that we are able to complete CRUD operations via the REST API. The **_user summary_**, **_technical summary_**, and **_user stories_** for this project are listed below in the [fictitious-company-inc-blog-app-requirements-stretch-goals.md](https://gist.github.com/IntrepidDemian/b6add456dc3af28e9e959bcc6a244be2#file-fictitious-company-inc-blog-app-requirements-stretch-goals-md) document. Please also read the **_constraints_** section as they apply to the project as well. If something is not covered in the constraints or starter application, the decision of implementation is left up to you.

**Top Tips**: While we are of course looking to use this for discussion about code in our final interview, we are also giving you an insight as to how we work on our projects from a requirements perspective. This means we will be looking at code decisions, documentation, and communication (including sensible comments both in-app and in GitHub commits), etc.

| **Constraint** | **Detail** |
| --- | --- |
| 3 Business Days | We ask that you complete the assessment and provide us a link to the public repo within 3 full business days after receiving the link to this Gist. |
| ~5 Hours | We structure this assessment so that the minimum ask is able to be completed in around 5 hours. However, we also provide additional items in the requirements documentation in case you able to complete more than the required within that ~ 5 hour window.
| Project Tech Stack | <ul><li>Required</li><ul><li>Java</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Optional</li><ul><li>Node</li></ul></ul> |
| User Stories | The user stories below have a priority based on what we would like included in the MVP of our Blog product and then another set of user stories for the stretch goal project. Meaning, at a minimum we believe that creating the project and completing all of the “high” story items in the MVP project should be within reason to complete in around 5 hours. <br /><br /><ol><li>HIGH - We would hope to see these completed within the ~5 hour window. Consider HIGH essential for the MVP</li><li>MED (Stretch Goal) - Not required, but a very strong “would like to have” for MVP</li><li>LOW (Stretch Goal) - Expected for post MVP work, but listed in case the developer can include them in MVP</li></ol> |
